           <br>
            Let me introduce you to my hobbies!<br> <br>
            I love singing since i was a kid, as i grew up i became intrested in musical instruments, 
            <br>at my 15th birthday ðŸŽ‚  my brother got me my first classical guitar! 
           

            <br><br><br>
            I'm obsessed over electric guitar and i wish i can buy one in the future
            
            
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            One of my dreams was becoming a member of a musical band but it's not possible due many reasons.
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            And i have a talent in drawing as well, i like to express my feeling throughout drawings. 
            
            
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            I also find joy in baking things like cakes, cookies, cheesecakes and i love dcorating them.
            
            Also I'm interested in martial arts so i went to a Taekwondo class
